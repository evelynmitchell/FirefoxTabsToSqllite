Great — glad it worked. Next recommended actions:

1. Push the extracted FirefoxTabsToSqllite repo to GitHub:
   - cd /workspaces/FirefoxTabsToSqllite
   - git remote add origin git@github.com:evelynmitchell/FirefoxTabsToSqllite.git (if remote not set)
   - git push -u origin HEAD
   - Note: GitHub authentication (SSH key or PAT) is required.

2. Verify CI runs after push:
   - Open the repository on GitHub and check Actions; the existing .github/workflows/ci.yml will trigger automatically.

3. Add status badges to README:
   - Add a GitHub Actions badge and coverage badge (use shields.io) to README.md and commit.

4. Install pre-commit hooks (Black, Ruff):
   - Create .pre-commit-config.yaml with Black and Ruff entries.
   - python -m pip install pre-commit
   - pre-commit install
   - Run pre-commit on all files: pre-commit run --all-files

5. Run tests and linters locally:
   - python -m pytest
   - ruff check .
   - black --check .

6. Continue repository cleanup and extraction:
   - Update Summary/repository_catalog.md with final decisions.
   - Create new repos for other candidate projects and repeat push + CI setup.

If you want, tell me which of the above to run next and I’ll provide exact config snippets or commands.
